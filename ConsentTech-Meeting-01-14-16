Call to create the consent tech space and to propose this as a place where Open Consent & Real Consent can formulate and develop. 

Proposal is to have a page where a Open Consent Framework can faciliate consent technologies to be used and faciliate a market for trust services. 

The idea is that we create a portal where consent, choice and notice technologies can be listed/registered, and can communicate, in effect having a charter to support and faciliate open consent and a consent tech industry. 

This also could include trustmarks and trsut services used to influence consent and trust.  So, what should this space be called?
