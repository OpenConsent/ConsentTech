Call to create the consent tech resource, tracking privacy and consent technology and standards, discussing what consent interoperability means
Objective is to create a repo here with resources to consent tech for a portal where privacy openness and consent are the primary focus. 

Master controller usable , choice and notice technologies can be listed/registered, and can communicate, in effect having a charter to support and faciliate open consent and a consent tech industry. 

This also could include trustmarks and trust services used to influence consent and trust.  
So, what should this space be called?
